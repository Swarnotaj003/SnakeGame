## TITLE OF THE PROJECT
Snake Game in Java

## INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to use Object Oriented Programming Principles (OOPs) to model all the elements of a software as classes and 
objects, and then use them to develop a Desktop application. The packages Java Swing and Java AWT are used to create the Graphical User 
Interface (GUI).

## FEATURES
- The up, down, left, and right keys will be used to give directions to the snake.
- The current and the best scores are displayed.
- If the snake hits the boundary/wall or hits its own tail, it dies i.e., game over.
- The cherry is placed at random positions every time.

## FOLDER STRUCTURE

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
